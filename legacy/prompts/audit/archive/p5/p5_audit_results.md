## CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES

### 🚨 GATED SCORE VIOLATIONS

1. **Corporate Tagline Missing:** 15 of 20 URLs (75%)
2. **Sub-Narratives Missing:** 17 of 20 URLs (85%)
3. **Platform Access Issues:** 2 URLs completely blocked (10%)

### 📊 BRAND CONSISTENCY CHECK

- **Logo Display:** ✅ Consistent across all accessible properties
- **Color Scheme:** ✅ Consistent visual identity
- **Typography:** ✅ Consistent font usage
- **Messaging:** ⚠️ Strong on social media, weak on owned content
- **Sub-Narratives:** ❌ Missing required regional/service narratives

### 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS FOR P5 PERSONA

- **Social media excellence:** LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter/X all feature corporate tagline prominently

- **Content quality high:** Thought leadership and expertise content scores well
- **Platform limitations:** Review sites block automated brand auditing

4. **Create Netherlands-specific content** differentiation

### SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (30-90 days)
