## üîÑ REPLICATION PROCESS FOR P2-P5

### Step 1: Prepare Persona Materials

For each new persona (P2, P3, P4, P5):

1. **Create persona folder**: `prompts/audit/p[X]-manus/`
2. **Required files**:
   - `p[X]_urls.md` - 20 URLs for audit (same as P1 or persona-specific)
   - Persona brief from `personas/v2/P[X].md`

### Step 2: Run Manus.ai Audit

#### A. Use the Refined Prompt

Copy the exact prompt from `../audit_brief_manus.md`:

```
SYSTEM
You are Sopra Steria's Brand-Audit engine.

Follow EVERY rule, weight and scoring instruction found in the attached file:
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit_method.md   (definitive methodology)

‚Ä¢ Never invent or alter criteria, names or weights.
‚Ä¢ Every criterion must be scored 0-10 with evidence quotes.
‚Ä¢ All weighting columns must sum to 100 %.
‚Ä¢ Apply validation errors and penalty flags exactly as written in the method.

USER
Context attachments for this audit run
1. Persona brief  : {{ATTACH: P[X].md}}
2. URL inventory  : {{ATTACH: p[X]_urls.md}}

[Rest of prompt as written in audit_brief_manus.md]
```

#### B. Attach Required Files

1. `../audit_method.md` (methodology - same for all)
2. `personas/v2/P[X].md` (specific persona)
3. `p[X]_urls.md` (URL list)

#### C. Execute Audit

- Send prompt to Manus.ai
- Save complete output as `p[X]_brand_audit_results.md`
- **Validate offsite scoring** against methodology

### Step 3: Validate and Correct Offsite Scoring

#### A. Check Offsite Compliance

Verify the audit follows exact methodology:

- **Owned Channels** (60% Brand | 40% Performance): LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter/X
- **Influenced Channels** (40% Brand | 60% Authenticity): Glassdoor
- **Independent Channels** (20% Brand | 80% Sentiment): Trustpilot

#### B. Correct if Needed

If offsite scoring is incorrect:

1. Use refined prompt focusing on offsite channels only
2. Save corrected output as `offsite_fixed.md`
3. Apply corrections to main audit file

#### C. Calculate Final Composite Score

```
Final Score = (On-site √ó 0.7 + Off-site √ó 0.3) √ó Crisis Multiplier
```

### Step 4: Create Analysis Files

#### A. Summary Analysis (`p[X]_audit_results.md`)

Based on P1 template, update:

- Persona focus and priorities
- Tier averages and ranges
- Top/bottom performing assets
- Critical findings specific to persona
- ROI projections and recommendations

#### B. Executive Summary (`p[X]_summary.md`)

Create dashboard-ready summary with:

- Final brand score prominently displayed
- Crisis alerts and urgent actions
- Top opportunities with ROI potential
- Immediate action checklist
- Dashboard integration recommendations

#### C. Data File (`p[X]_audit_data.csv`)

Export data in standardized format:

```csv
URL,Asset_Name,Tier,Category,Score,Brand_Score,Performance_Score,Key_Issues,Priority_Actions,Strategic_Impact
```

- **Must validate** against methodology before proceeding
- Use corrected offsite approach from `offsite_fixed.md`

### 2. **Crisis Detection**

- **Any asset scoring <3.0** requires immediate escalation
- Unclaimed profiles = automatic crisis status
- Poor ratings (<2.5/5) = urgent intervention needed

### 3. **Persona-Specific Insights**

- Don't just copy P1 findings
- Focus on **persona priorities** from brief
- Adjust regional narratives appropriately
- Consider industry-specific compliance needs

### 4. **Mathematical Precision**

- Validate all composite scores
- Ensure tier averages match individual scores
- Double-check final brand score calculation
