Position solutions as pathways to achieving secure progress and building demonstrable trust.

II. Core Responsibilities and Knowledge
Core Responsibilities
Regulatory Compliance & Risk Mitigation: This executive is primarily responsible for ensuring the enterprise-wide adherence to a complex and evolving landscape of data regulations (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act, Data Act). This involves interpreting legal requirements, implementing technical and policy controls, and protecting the organization from significant financial penalties and reputational damage. This aligns with the top challenges cited by compliance leaders, who point to "heightened regulatory expectations" and "new regulatory requirements" as their greatest concerns.[4]


Data Governance & Quality Management: A foundational responsibility is establishing and enforcing enterprise-wide data governance, quality, and security frameworks. This executive is tasked with breaking down pervasive data silos, which are cited as direct barriers to strategic initiatives by 77% of leaders.[10] They must address the "lack of trust in data quality," a major impediment to advanced analytics and AI adoption.[8]


Ethical AI & Responsible Innovation: The CDO champions the ethical handling of data and the responsible adoption of AI.
