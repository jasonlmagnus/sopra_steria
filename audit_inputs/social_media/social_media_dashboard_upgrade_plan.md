# Social Media Dashboard Upgrade Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the current social media dashboard and available data sources, this upgrade plan addresses critical issues and leverages rich insights from the complete audit to create a more powerful and insightful analytics tool.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Data Inconsistencies

- **"Global/UK" vs "UK" vs "Global"** naming confusion
- Facebook UK page serves dual role as global English presence
- Inconsistent regional categorization across platforms

### 2. Limited Data Utilization

- Only using structured `sm_dashboard_data.md` (basic metrics)
- Rich qualitative insights in `sm_audit_1.md` underutilized
- Missing performance benchmarks and competitive context

### 3. Technical Issues

- 404 errors on Streamlit health endpoints (minor but needs monitoring)
- Data loading debug information cluttering interface
- Limited visualization types for complex relationships

## Upgrade Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Data Enhancement & Cleanup (Priority: HIGH)

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

#### 1.1 Regional Naming Standardization

- **Current**: "Global/UK", "UK", "Global" confusion
- **Solution**: Clear hierarchy: Global > Regional (UK, Benelux, France)
- **Implementation**: Update data parsing to handle Facebook UK as separate entity

#### 1.2 Enhanced Data Integration

- **Current**: Basic metrics only
- **Solution**: Integrate comprehensive audit insights
- **Data Sources**:
  - Platform metrics (followers, engagement)
  - Content performance analysis
  - Audience composition data
  - Best practice examples
  - Competitive benchmarking

#### 1.3 Data Quality Improvements

```python
# Enhanced data structure
{
    "platform_metrics": "Basic follower/engagement data",
    "content_performance": "Top performing content by platform/region",
    "audience_insights": "Composition and behavior data",
    "competitive_benchmarks": "Industry comparison data",
    "best_practices": "Successful content examples",
    "recommendations": "Actionable insights by priority"
}
```

### Phase 2: Visualization Enhancements (Priority: HIGH)

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

#### 2.1 Platform Performance Matrix

Replace the current "ridiculous" engagement level scatter plot with:

- **2x2 Matrix**: Reach (followers) vs Engagement Quality
- **Bubble Chart**: Size = content volume, Color = platform
- **Quadrant Analysis**:
  - High Reach + High Engagement = "Star Performers"
  - High Reach + Low Engagement = "Sleeping Giants"
  - Low Reach + High Engagement = "Niche Champions"
  - Low Reach + Low Engagement = "Development Needed"

#### 2.2 Content Performance Heatmap

- **Rows**: Content types (Employee spotlights, Case studies, Service updates, etc.)
- **Columns**: Platforms/Regions
- **Color**: Engagement performance
- **Hover**: Best practice examples

#### 2.3 Regional Strategy Comparison

- **Side-by-side cards** for Global, UK, Benelux strategies
- **Key metrics**: Primary objective, content focus, unique characteristics
- **Performance indicators**: Success metrics by region

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

#### 3.1 Content Theme Analysis

- **Performance tracking** by content theme across platforms
- **Trend analysis**: Which themes perform best where
- **Recommendation engine**: Suggest content themes by platform/region

#### 3.2 Competitive Intelligence Dashboard

- **Benchmarking section** comparing Sopra Steria to industry averages
- **Competitive positioning** visualization
- **Gap analysis** and opportunity identification

#### 3.3 ROI and Impact Metrics

- **Engagement value scoring** based on platform and audience
- **Content efficiency metrics** (engagement per post, reach per follower)
- **Strategic alignment indicators** (brand consistency scores)

### Phase 4: Interactive Features (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

#### 4.1 Dynamic Filtering

- **Multi-dimensional filters**: Platform + Region + Content Type + Time Period
- **Saved filter presets**: Quick access to common analyses
- **Filter impact indicators**: Show how filters affect data scope

#### 4.2 Drill-Down Capabilities

- **Click-through from overview to detailed analysis**
- **Content example galleries** with performance context
- **Platform-specific deep dives** with tailored insights

#### 4.3 Export and Sharing

- **Report generation** with key insights
- **Shareable dashboard links** with filter states
- **Data export** for external analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Data Loading

```python
def load_enhanced_social_media_data():
    """Load comprehensive social media data from multiple sources"""
    return {
        'platform_metrics': parse_platform_metrics(),
        'content_performance': extract_content_insights(),
        'audience_data': parse_audience_composition(),
        'benchmarks': load_competitive_data(),
        'recommendations': extract_actionable_insights(),
        'best_practices': compile_success_examples()
    }
```

### Regional Data Standardization

```python
def standardize_regional_data(raw_data):
    """Clean up Global/UK confusion and standardize naming"""
    # Map Facebook UK to both UK regional and Global English presence
    # Separate Instagram regional accounts properly
    # Handle YouTube channel hierarchy correctly
    return standardized_data
```

### Performance Matrix Calculation

```python
def calculate_performance_matrix(platform_data):
    """Create 2x2 performance matrix with proper scaling"""
    # Normalize follower counts (log scale for reach)
    # Consolidate engagement levels (High/Medium/Low)
    # Calculate performance quadrants
    # Add platform-specific context
    return matrix_data
```

## Content Strategy Enhancements

### 1. Content Performance Insights

**Replace basic tables with interactive analysis:**

- **Top Performers**: Highlight best-performing content by platform
- **Success Patterns**: Identify what makes content successful
- **Content Gaps**: Show underperforming areas with recommendations

### 2. Platform-Specific Strategies

**Detailed breakdown by platform:**
