## ‚ö†Ô∏è Top 3 Brand Risks or Friction Points

1. **Over-Reliance on High-Level Messaging**  
   Homepage and banners may feel generic without surfacing technical value early. Risk of misjudging the site as shallow if user doesn‚Äôt dive deeper.

2. **Navigation and Redundancy Quirks**  
   Repeated sections (e.g., Cybersecurity listed twice); Modernization-related content scattered across multiple subpages; Harder for persona to pinpoint what they want.

3. **Lack of Interactive/Instant Contact Options**  
   No live chat or form; only phone/email. A technical evaluator may delay outreach if the path isn‚Äôt frictionless or clearly tied to an expert.

## üåü Top 3 Brand Opportunities to Strengthen Appeal & Trust

1. **Surface Technical Credentials & Partnerships**  
   Elevate mentions of AWS, SAP, Red Hat partnerships on service pages or homepage (e.g., badges or ‚ÄúWhat makes us different?‚Äù section).

2. **Double Down on Case Studies & Outcomes**  
   Use stats + summaries (e.g., ‚Äú95% compliance‚Äù, ‚Äúzero downtime‚Äù) on high-traffic pages. Create a filterable library of success stories by industry or service.

3. **Humanize Expertise ("Meet the Experts")**  
   Showcase key architects or leads; Add quotes, bios, or short video clips on pages like Cloud or SAP to signal real depth and give a personal connection.

**In conclusion**, Sopra Steria Benelux's digital journey is largely effective in earning the trust of the Technical Influencer. With modest adjustments‚Äîlike surfacing credibility sooner, simplifying access paths, and showing more faces behind the brand‚Äîit could become a standout example of how to attract and convert technical decision-makers through digital channels.
