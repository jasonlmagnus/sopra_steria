| **1. Homepage**<br>URL: [soprasteria.be](https://www.soprasteria.be/)                                                                                                                                  | **Clarity/Relevance:** The promise of efficiency and innovation is clear but very broad. It doesn‚Äôt yet speak to specific C-suite concerns like AI or compliance.<br>**Differentiation:** Messaging is generic ‚Äì similar to many consultancies ‚Äì and the tagline doesn‚Äôt emphasize Sopra Steria‚Äôs European identity or local trust advantage. The European angle only appears in the footer, which may be missed.<br>**Credibility:** Employee/office stats support scale. Visual design is clean and navigable. However, no obvious European trust cues in the hero section. | **3/5 ‚Äì Moderate gap**<br>The core value proposition is too generic and not directly tuned to the persona‚Äôs priorities. | Refine the hero message to spotlight trusted European digital transformation, or domains like AI or resilience. Add subtle client success stat or EU trust mark to increase distinctiveness and credibility. |
| **2. Service Page ‚Äì Cybersecurity**<br>URL: [Cybersecurity Services](https://www.soprasteria.be/whatwedo/cybersecurity)                                                                                | **Clarity:** High-level, aspirational language. ‚ÄúSerenity‚Äù, ‚Äúresilience‚Äù, and ‚Äústeady hand‚Äù align well with executive priorities.<br>**Relevance:** Strong alignment with cyber-sovereignty and regulatory concerns (e.g., NIS2).<br>**Distinctiveness:** Tone of calm leadership is somewhat unique, though abstract.<br>**Credibility:** 3,000+ experts and ‚ÄúUnited for cyber-sovereignty‚Äù signals strength. However, specifics are buried in subpages.                                                                                                                     | **2/5 ‚Äì Minor gap**<br>The poetic tone may obscure practical offerings for execs skimming for relevance.                | Include a brief bullet or sidebar summary of core services (e.g. risk assessments, NIS2 compliance). Preserve tone but ground it in deliverables.                                                            |

Proof Point ‚Äì Curium Case Study**<br>URL: [Curium Success Story](https://www.soprasteria.be/newsroom/success-stories/details/curium-strengthening-it-compliance-for-a-secure-and-scalable-future) | **Clarity/Credibility:** Strong alignment with persona goals ‚Äì compliance, security, and partnership. Cites 95% compliance maturity achieved and features a strong client quote.<br>**Relevance:** Extremely high for execs managing resilience and regulatory pressure.<br>**Visuals:** Text-heavy; key results buried. No prominent CTA to encourage contact.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **1/5 ‚Äì Low gap**<br>Strong on message, weak on conversion path and visual emphasis.                                    | Add a short visual summary (e.g., ‚Äú95% compliance maturity ‚Äì see how‚Äù), bold key stats, and include a CTA like ‚ÄúTalk to us about compliance success‚Äù.                                                        |

Thought Leadership ‚Äì DORA Whitepaper**<br>URL: [DORA Whitepaper](https://www.soprasteria.be/newsroom/whitepapers/dora-a-new-pillar-of-digital-resilience)                                         | **Clarity:** Very focused on topic. Frames DORA as strategic advantage, not just compliance.<br>**Relevance:** High ‚Äì directly useful to regulated sectors.<br>**Distinctiveness:** Goes beyond standard summaries; features CISO commentary.<br>**Credibility:** Strong regulatory understanding and EU-centric framing.<br>**UX:** Encourages download, but lacks links to relevant services or experts.                                                                                                                                                                    | **2/5 ‚Äì Minor gap**<br>Strong on credibility, weak on conversion to services or contact.                                | Add follow-up CTA: ‚ÄúReady for DORA? Talk to our experts.‚Äù Link to compliance advisory services or contact.                                                                                                   |

Mentions ‚Äútrusted Digital Business Partner.‚Äù<br>**Relevance:** Lists offices across Benelux (Machelen, etc.) which boosts trust.<br>**Credibility:** Real-world addresses, direct phones add substance.<br>**UX/CRO:** No contact form or digital CTA ‚Äì only email/phone. No live chat or expert contact, despite being mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **4/5 ‚Äì High gap**<br>No web form or easy way to convert. High friction for busy executives.                            | Add a simple contact form or callback option. Even a ‚ÄúContact an expert‚Äù CTA linked to solutions would improve digital UX.                                                                                   |

## üîç Top Brand Opportunities/Risks (Prioritized)

1. **Sharpen Homepage Value Proposition**  
   The homepage lacks a clear differentiation. A more focused statement on Sopra Steria‚Äôs strengths (e.g., European trust, regulatory fluency, AI delivery) could instantly resonate with exec visitors.

2. **Balance Inspiration with Clarity on Service Pages**  
   Inspirational tone is unique but may confuse execs seeking fast answers. Injecting bullet points or summaries of services can fix this without diluting brand style.

3. **Leverage Proof-Points More Prominently**  
   There are strong case studies hidden in the site. Consider surfacing them earlier in the journey or adding rotating banners with stats and logos to drive credibility from the start.

4. **Improve CTA and Conversion Paths**  
   Many content-rich pages lack a clear prompt for next action. Adding subtle, role-relevant CTAs (‚ÄúWant similar results?‚Äù) can lift lead conversion.

5. **Reduce Contact Friction**  
   The current contact flow is outdated. A short, user-friendly contact form would capture more interest, especially from mobile users and busy execs who prefer digital outreach.
