# Gap Analyzer Tool

## Overview

The Gap Analyzer is a dynamic development quality assurance tool that validates React component functionality and detects missing features in the Brand Health Dashboard.

## Purpose

After achieving parity between Streamlit and React implementations, this tool serves as:
- **Regression Prevention**: Automatically detects when features are accidentally removed
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates that critical components are functioning correctly
- **Development Guide**: Provides actionable fix suggestions for identified gaps
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks overall dashboard health with scoring

## Features

### 🔍 Component Analysis
- Validates existence of expected React components
- Checks for required filters, metrics, and charts
- Analyzes component content for missing features

### 🌐 API Validation
- Tests API endpoint availability
- Validates API response codes
- Checks integration between frontend and backend

### 🗺️ Routing Verification
- Ensures components are properly imported
- Validates routing configuration
- Checks navigation integration

### 📊 Data Consistency
- Verifies required data files exist
- Validates data structure integrity
- Checks for missing dependencies

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run from project root
python audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py

# Or make it executable and run directly
./audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Specify project root (if not running from project directory)
python audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py --project-root /path/to/project

# Custom output file
python audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py --output my_gap_report.json

# Custom API base URL
python audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py --api-base http://localhost:8000
```

## Expected Components

The tool validates these React components:
- **ExecutiveDashboard**: Main dashboard with KPIs and metrics
- **PersonaInsights**: Persona comparison and analysis
- **ContentMatrix**: Content performance matrix
- **Recommendations**: Strategic recommendations with filtering
- **SuccessLibrary**: Success story analysis

## Gap Severity Levels

### 🔴 Critical
- Missing essential components
- API server connection failures
- Core functionality broken

### 🟡 High
- Missing expected component files
- API endpoint failures
- Major feature gaps

### 🟠 Medium
- Missing filters or metrics
- Routing issues
- Data consistency problems

### 🟢 Low
- Missing chart implementations
- Minor feature gaps
- Enhancement opportunities

## Output

### Console Output
- Real-time progress updates
- Summary with gap counts by severity
- Health score calculation
- Actionable fix suggestions

### JSON Report
- Detailed gap analysis report
- Timestamp and metadata
- Structured data for automation
- Integration-ready format

## Integration with CI/CD

```bash
# Example CI/CD usage
python audit_tool/gap_analyzer.py
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Critical gaps detected! Failing build."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Health Scoring

The tool calculates an overall health score:
- **90-100%**: Excellent - Dashboard is in great shape
- **70-89%**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **50-69%**: Fair - Several issues need attention
- **<50%**: Poor - Significant issues require immediate attention

## Development Workflow

1. **Before Code Changes**: Run gap analysis to establish baseline
2. **During Development**: Use fix suggestions to guide implementation
3. **After Changes**: Verify no regressions introduced
4. **Before Deployment**: Ensure no critical gaps exist

## Customization

To add new components or modify validation rules, update the `expected_features` dictionary in `GapAnalyzer.__init__()`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library for API testing
- Project structure with `web/`, `api/`, and `audit_tool/` directories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect to API server"**
- Ensure API server is running: `npm run dev` in `api/` directory
- Check API base URL configuration

**"Missing pages directory"**
- Verify React project structure exists
- Check `web/src/pages/` directory

**"Component analysis errors"**
- Verify file permissions
- Check component file syntax

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with testing frameworks
- Automated fix suggestions
- Performance monitoring
- Visual gap reporting
- Integration with project management tools
