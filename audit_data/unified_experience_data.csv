It signals that the vendor understands the core tension in my role. | ""Technology you can trust: Our experts build the required infrastructure to support the ecosystem – from integrating systems, building a data platform and layers of defence (cybersecurity and privacy) through to setting up a governance model."": This directly addresses my need for secure, compliant infrastructure and governance. It aligns with my priority of embedding cybersecurity within digital transformation. | ""When you get data security and privacy right and conduct good risk management, you can be sure that things will never really get out of hand."": A pragmatic reassurance that risk is manageable with proper controls, which aligns with my mandate to maintain operational resilience and compliance under evolving threats.","""Ecosystems? Yes, please but how can we trust each other?"" (title and opening question): The title is catchy but vague. It raises the issue of trust without immediately clarifying the business or security context, which diminishes its impact for an executive audience. | ""Sure, the concept is not new... Many big companies have long-standing trade agreements with suppliers."": This is generic and adds little strategic value. It does not differentiate the approach or highlight innovation, which I require to justify ecosystem investment. | ""That’s why more and more supply chain leaders build ecosystem partnerships."": This phrase is too broad and passive. It lacks concrete examples or quantifiable benefits that resonate with my need for measurable ROI and risk mitigation. | ""If everyone understands that the partnership is a win-win, they’ll be more likely to collaborate and share data."": While conceptually true, this is overly simplistic and lacks guidance on how to operationalize trust-building, a critical challenge given legacy systems and regulatory demands. | ""The government is an enabler for partnerships, as it instills trust."": This statement is too generic and does not clarify how regulatory frameworks (e.g., DORA, NIS2) concretely support ecosystem security or compliance, which is a key concern for me. | ""Demonstrating added value is indeed key,"": This phrase is a platitude without concrete KPIs or business outcomes, which limits its usefulness for executive decision-making.",Neutral,Low,Low

The emphasis on ""improving user experience"" without clear security or privacy assurances does not address my priority of regulatory compliance and risk management. It feels like compliance is treated as a checkbox, not a strategic imperative. | ""We respecteren privacy, daarom geven we controle over de manier waarop we met gegevens omgaan."": This statement is vague and lacks concrete details on how privacy is respected or what controls are offered. As someone accountable for data protection and regulatory compliance, I need clear articulation of privacy governance, data minimization, and user consent management. The phrase reads as marketing fluff rather than a substantive commitment aligned with GDPR or NIS2 requirements. | Extensive cookie list with descriptions like ""Google Analytics plaatst deze cookie om bezoekers-, sessie- en campagnegegevens te berekenen"" and ""Microsoft Clarity plaatst deze cookie om de Clarity gebruikers-ID van de browser en instellingen exclusief voor die website te behouden."": The cookie inventory is thorough but presented as a raw list without contextualizing risk or compliance posture. As a CISO/CIO, I want to understand how these cookies impact data privacy, what mitigations are in place, and how user consent is managed systematically. The lack of linkage to compliance frameworks or risk controls diminishes its practical value for decision-making. | ""Wij zijn Ordina.

There is insufficient clarity on how AI concretely supports security and compliance objectives in a regulated public sector context. | ""Sustainability with Cloud services Evaluate and apply sustainable practices throughout the lifecycle of your assets."": Sustainability is relevant but secondary to my priorities. This section lacks linkage to risk reduction or compliance benefits, making it less compelling for me. | ""LET'S TALK Discover our Digital and Cloud services with Microsoft Azure to adapt your foundation"": The call-to-action is weak and generic. It does not address the business or security outcomes I require before engaging further. | ""Modern workplace Define your collaborative strategy with AI-powered, hybrid working models ... while adhering to security and compliance standards."": This is promising but underdeveloped.

The mention of end-to-end support from training to industrialization signals an understanding of enterprise complexity and the need for holistic solutions, which is critical for me in mitigating execution risk and managing legacy system constraints. | ""Today, only 1 in 7 algorithms reaches the production phase,"": This candid admission of AI deployment challenges resonates with me as a realistic acknowledgment of the gap between AI experimentation and operationalization.

The text does not provide supporting data or explain how this growth will translate into tangible business outcomes or competitive advantage for my enterprise. | ""Connect with one of our experts today to explore tailored solutions and get all the information you need. Let's talk"": This call to action is generic and lacks urgency or clear value proposition.

The sprawling menu and repetitive lists dilute focus and make it difficult to identify the most critical differentiators for my needs. | Limited explicit references to measurable business outcomes, ROI, or client impact metrics: Without concrete proof points or quantified benefits, I cannot confidently assess the value of their offerings relative to my strategic objectives, such as growth, resilience, or cost efficiency.",Neutral,Low,Low

It helps bridge the gap between technical complexity and strategic application, enabling me to consider concrete adoption pathways. | ""Cybersecurity: Cyber threats are evolving rapidly, and adopting innovative solutions is essential to protect your business."": This directly addresses one of my critical pain points—cybersecurity—and underscores the importance of innovation, which is a priority for balancing growth with resilience.

But here too, developments are moving fast. Newer models like Chat GPT-4 have gotten a lot bigger with over 128000 tokens, so usually the context window is not really a problem anymore."": While somewhat informative, this level of technical detail on tokens and context windows is too granular for my executive perspective. It lacks connection to business impact or strategic decision making, rendering it less useful for my priorities. | ""Sure! 😊 Based on our catalogue, I recommend two great options for waterproof hiking shoes: 1. TrailWalker Hiking Shoes and 2. TrekHiker Walking Booths."": The example is overly casual and consumer-focused, which does not resonate with my enterprise-level concerns.

This appeals to my strategic focus on balancing growth with operational efficiency. | ""Cloud security services: AI-powered, zero-trust-driven solutions ensuring your Azure environment is secure, resilient, and compliant."": Security is a top pain point for me, especially with increasing cyber threats. The mention of zero-trust and AI-powered security is reassuring, indicating a modern and proactive approach to cybersecurity, which is essential for enterprise resilience. | ""18-year strategic partnership with Microsoft"": Long-term partnership with a major technology player like Microsoft reinforces credibility and stability, which is important to me given the risks of vendor lock-in and the need for reliable technology alliances.","""LET'S TALK"": This call to action is generic and lacks executive appeal.

It lacks differentiation and does not address my immediate concerns such as legacy system integration or measurable ROI. | ""Our blogs Will your company survive the AI revolution? 2025"": While topical, this headline is alarmist and does not inspire confidence or strategic insight. As a C-suite leader, I prefer content that offers actionable intelligence rather than fear-based framing. | ""Sopra HR Software CIMPA Open main menu Industries Ë…"": The presence of navigation artifacts and formatting issues detracts from the professionalism of the page and can erode my confidence in their attention to detail and quality of delivery. | ""Please Select"" (in contact form dropdowns without clear options): Lack of clarity or incomplete form options can frustrate and discourage engagement, especially when I am looking for quick, streamlined communications. It signals a lack of localization or customization for the Benelux market. | ""We secure and optimize data and AI to drive improved business outcomes."": This sentence is generic and does not specify how or to what extent outcomes are improved.

This statement is clear and aligned with my concerns about enterprise resilience. | ""Regulatory compliance: Keeping you up to date with evolving compliance requirements and tightening data protection regulation."": Regulatory complexity in Benelux and Europe is a significant burden. This demonstrates awareness of evolving requirements, which is essential for long-term viability. | ""Data protection: Safeguarding your organisation and client data from the risks of fraud and cybercrime."": Cybersecurity threats are a constant pain point.

It succinctly connects digital transformation to positive, long-term impact, which is critical for enterprise resilience and market positioning in the Benelux. It signals a forward-looking mindset that I expect from a strategic partner. | “We want to help make the world more sustainable by rallying all of our stakeholders to the cause.”: This shows an understanding of the ecosystem approach I value—engaging clients, partners, suppliers, and shareholders. It reflects a recognition that enterprise success is interconnected with sustainability and social responsibility, which resonates with my need for holistic, cross-functional solutions. | “We require all stakeholders in our value chain to commit to reducing the environmental impact of their business.”: This is strategically relevant as it demonstrates accountability beyond the company itself, addressing supply chain risks and environmental compliance—key concerns for me given current regulatory and operational pressures in Benelux enterprises. It signals a rigorous approach rather than lip service. | “The Group has long been committed to combatting discrimination and promoting equal opportunities.”: Diversity and inclusion are key elements of talent strategy and risk mitigation in my region. This statement reassures me that the company understands the importance of human capital challenges and social responsibility, which are critical to sustainable growth.","“Taking a new look at our company” (video unavailable due to consent management setup): The absence of the video content due to technical or privacy compliance issues is a missed opportunity. As a C-suite executive, I expect seamless access to thought leadership and strategic messaging. This undermines credibility and frustrates my ability to quickly assess their corporate responsibility stance. | “We strive to get innovation working for as many people as possible.”: This is vague and lacks specificity. Innovation is a broad term; without concrete examples or outcomes, it feels generic and unconvincing. As an executive, I need clarity on how innovation translates into measurable business or societal impact, especially related to resilience or growth. | “We interact with our entire ecosystem to ensure that these commitments deliver value for everyone.”: This phrase is generic and does not specify how value is measured or delivered. For me, the language should emphasize outcomes, KPIs, or case studies, not just intentions. Without this, it fails to demonstrate the tangible business benefits or risk mitigation that matter at the C-suite level. | “Our primary responsibility is to ensure our financial development and long-term future, at the same time as considering our impact on society locally and globally.”: While this sentence acknowledges financial and social balance, it is high-level and abstract. It lacks detail on how these dual objectives are operationalized or integrated into business strategy, which is essential for my evaluation of a potential partner’s maturity and alignment with my enterprise’s goals. | “Compliance with the highest standards of business ethics is a prime requirement, and one we also demand from our clients, suppliers and partners.”: This is an important claim but unsupported by any mention of specific certifications, audit results, or governance frameworks.

It helps frame the conversation in measurable, market-driven terms. | ""If resilience and flexibility are the key to a futureproof supply chain, then working on a supply chain island is definitely not the way to go."": This statement captures a key strategic insight succinctly and aligns well with my priority to build resilient, adaptable operations. It clearly articulates the problem with legacy, isolated systems, which is a pain point I constantly struggle with, and motivates ecosystem thinking. | ""Trust is a must for ecosystem partners to work together successfully, yet building trust takes time... start small in scope, but with a long-term ambition"": This advice is pragmatic and resonates with my experience managing complex stakeholder environments. It acknowledges the challenge of trust realistically and suggests a sensible approach to incremental ecosystem development, which I can operationalize in my programmes.","""The large airport operator exchanges data with many different parties in the airport ecosystem: from the Panos bakery chain, luggage brand Samsonite and the Belgian railways to taxi companies, etc."": While the example is concrete, the choice of partners (bakery, luggage brand, taxi) feels trivial and anecdotal rather than strategic. As a transformation leader, I want to see examples that reflect scale, complexity, and measurable business outcomes. This example lacks depth and does not demonstrate significant ROI or strategic impact. | ""If everyone understands that the partnership is a win-win for both parties, they’ll be more likely to collaborate and share data."": This is a platitude that lacks actionable insight or differentiation. While win-win is a business cliché, I expect more rigorous frameworks or methodologies on how to establish and prove mutual value, especially given the risks and legacy system constraints I face. It reads as superficial and does not address my need for governance or risk mitigation strategies. | ""When you get data security and privacy right and conduct good risk management, you can be sure that things will never really get out of hand."": This statement is vague and overly optimistic. As a CDO/CIDO, I know cybersecurity risks are never zero, and “never really get out of hand” is not a measurable or reassuring claim. I would prefer concrete standards, certifications, or compliance frameworks that Sopra Steria supports to mitigate these risks effectively. | ""Unsure where to start? Trust Ordina to put your collaboration efforts on the right track: Inspire to desire... Technology you can trust... Engage your people."": The call to action is generic and lacks specificity.

It does not convey a unique value proposition or relevance to my specific transformation challenges in the Benelux context. It risks being perceived as marketing fluff unless substantiated by tangible insights or recommendations. | Navigation and menu structure (e.g., long lists of industries and services with little contextual explanation): The overwhelming menu and list format without clear prioritization or contextual framing makes it difficult for me to quickly find relevant information.

It signals a structured approach to AI that can help me prioritize investments and manage complexity. | ""This structuring of the market enables our customers to optimise their investments and ensures they fully explore AI’s potential without overlooking any areas."": This resonates well as it directly addresses my priority to maximize ROI and avoid blind spots in technology adoption. It speaks to the need for comprehensive yet targeted AI strategies, which is essential for large-scale transformation programmes. | ""The real challenge is to successfully industrialise [AI algorithms]. Today, only 1 in 7 algorithms reaches the production phase."": This candid admission reflects an understanding of a key pain point I face: moving from pilot to scale. It adds credibility and highlights that the company grasps the operational hurdles beyond hype, which is critical for me when evaluating vendor and consultancy partners. | ""Sopra Steria Next has developed dedicated offerings, ranging from training and onboarding to the creation of POCs, the modernisation of Data/AI technology platforms and industrialisation with the setting up of AI Factories."": This is valuable because it outlines a holistic, end-to-end approach to AI adoption, which matches my need for partners who can support transformation initiatives from strategy through execution and scaling, addressing both technology and organisational readiness.","""AI for Humans encompasses successive generations of decision support tools and different types of virtual assistants (Copilot, HuggingFace, ChatGPT, etc.)."": This is vague and somewhat superficial.

I require explicit linkage to how these growth areas translate into tangible ROI, cost savings, or revenue impact within my industry and organisation size. Numbers alone do not justify investment decisions. | ""Interested in learning more? Connect with one of our experts today to explore tailored solutions and get all the information you need."": This call to action is generic and lacks urgency or specificity.

It frames AI not as hype but as a tool with clear operational levers to improve outcomes. | ""Function calling enables LLMs to go beyond generating text by executing actions, retrieving live data, or interacting with external systems."": This highlights integration with existing systems and process automation, which speaks directly to my priority of embedding AI within complex enterprise environments to drive ROI and operational efficiency. | ""Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge bases into AI queries... combining the retrieved data with the original query before passing it to the LLM."": This addresses a key concern for me: overcoming AI limitations related to outdated training data by linking AI to real-time enterprise data.

For an executive audience, I expect a more consultative, outcome-oriented invitation—e.g., to discuss specific challenges or ROI scenarios—rather than a casual phrase that lacks urgency or strategic framing. | Absence of concrete Benelux or regional references or local success stories: Given my geographic scope, the lack of local examples or region-specific insights reduces relevance. I want to see how Sopra Steria addresses unique regulatory, cultural, or market dynamics in Benelux to mitigate risk and ensure contextual fit. | Limited explicit discussion of legacy system modernization challenges: Legacy systems are my top pain point, but the text glosses over the complexity of integrating or replacing legacy infrastructure.
