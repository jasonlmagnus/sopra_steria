# Implementation Plan: Persona Experience & Brand Audit Tool

This document breaks down the development work for the tool into a prioritized, task-based plan.

**STATUS: ðŸš¨ PHASE 8 BLOCKED - Critical Runtime Errors**

---

## **PHASE 1: Core Persona Experience Report (âœ… COMPLETE)**

_This phase focused on building the end-to-end pipeline for the primary goal: generating the Persona Experience Report._

- [x] **Project Setup**: Virtual environment, dependencies, `.env`.
- [x] **Initial Scaffolding**: `audit_tool/` directory and empty module files.
- [x] **Core Scraper Implementation**: `Scraper` class with `fetch_page`.
- [x] **Core AI & Narrative Generator Implementation**: `AIInterface` with `generate_narrative`, `NarrativeGenerator` class.
- [x] **Core Reporting Implementation**: `Reporter` class with a basic save method.
- [x] **Main Application Wiring**: `main.py` with `argparse`, component orchestration.

---

## **PHASE 2: Brand Hygiene Scorecard (âœ… COMPLETE)**

_This phase implemented the tool's second core output: a deterministic, methodology-driven Brand Hygiene Scorecard._

- [x] **Scraper Enhancement for Objective Data**: Implemented objective checks.
- [x] **Methodology Parser & Rules Engine**: `MethodologyParser` and `Criterion`, `Tier`, `Methodology` dataclasses.
- [x] **Scorecard Generator Implementation**: `ScorecardGenerator` with tier classification and AI-assisted scoring.
- [x] **Reporter Enhancement for Dual Output**: `Jinja2` integration and `scorecard_template.md`.
- [x] **Final Integration in Main**: Added `ScorecardGenerator` to the main execution flow.

---

## **PHASE 3: Bug Fixing & Stabilization (âœ… COMPLETE)**

_This phase addressed critical bugs and stability issues to ensure the tool is reliable and produces accurate, high-quality output._

- [x] **Robustness**:
  - [x] Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
  - [x] Implemented a retry mechanism for failed API calls in `ai_interface.py`.
  - [x] Implemented robust JSON parsing in `SummaryGenerator` to prevent crashes from malformed AI responses.
- [x] **Core Logic Correction**:
  - [x] **Fixed Persona-Ignoring Bug**: Overhauled the `generate_narrative` prompt in `ai_interface.py` to correctly and forcefully adopt the persona's point of view, removing conflicting instructions.
  - [x] **Fixed Template Crashing Bugs**: Corrected multiple `UndefinedError` crashes in Jinja2 templates by aligning the variables in the templates (`scorecard_template.md`, `summary_template.md`) with the data objects passed from `reporter.py`.
- [x] **Usability**:
  - [x] Added support for batch processing a list of URLs from a file (`--file` argument).
  - [x] Added progress indicators (`tqdm`) for long-running processes.
  - [x] Implemented a file-based caching layer for scraped content to speed up iterative testing.

---

## **PHASE 4: Strategic Summary Generation (âœ… COMPLETE)**

_This phase introduced the final component: a generator that synthesizes all individual audit reports into a single, high-level strategic summary._

- [x] **Summary Generator Scaffolding**:
  - [x] In `audit_tool/generators.py`, created the `SummaryGenerator` class.
  - [x] In `audit_tool/reporter.py`, added the `write_summary_report` method.
  - [x] Created the Jinja2 template: `templates/summary_template.md`.
- [x] **Quantitative Data Aggregation**:
  - [x] The `SummaryGenerator` now parses all `_hygiene_scorecard.md` files.
  - [x] It extracts scores, calculates tier averages, and identifies top/bottom pages.
- [x] **Qualitative Thematic Synthesis**:
  - [x] The `SummaryGenerator` parses all `_experience_report.md` files.
  - [x] It uses a dedicated `generate_strategic_summary` method in the `AIInterface` to perform thematic analysis and generate a JSON summary.
- [x] **Final Integration in Main**:
  - [x] After the main URL loop, the `SummaryGenerator` is called to create the summary object, which is then saved by the `Reporter`.

---

## **PHASE 5: UI/UX Development (âœ… COMPLETE)**

_This phase focused on building a user-friendly interface for the tool, moving beyond the command line._

- [x] **Task 1: Static UI Layout** - Created `dashboard/streamlit_dashboard.py` with sidebar and main panel components.
- [x] **Task 2: State Management and Input Logic** - Implemented session state tracking and input validation.
- [x] **Task 3: Backend Process Execution** - Integrated subprocess execution with temporary file management.
- [x] **Task 4: Real-time Log Streaming** - Added live audit log display with real-time updates.
- [x] **Task 5: Results Discovery and Parsing** - Implemented automated results scanning and grouping.
- [x] **Task 6: Dynamic Results Display** - Created expandable results with tabbed content display.
- [x] **Task 7: Final Polish & Cleanup** - Added error handling, temp file cleanup, and user feedback.

   UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'brand_health' where it is not associated with a value
   ```

2. **KeyError in Conversion Metrics**

   ```
   File "brand_health_command_center.py", line 315
   st.metric("Conversion Score", f"{conversion['score']:.1f}/10")
   KeyError: 'score'
   ```

3. **StreamlitDuplicateElementId in Content Matrix**
   ```
   streamlit.errors.StreamlitDuplicateElementId: There are multiple `plotly_chart` elements with the same auto-generated ID
   ```

## **Current Status: ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY REPAIR NEEDED**

The audit tool core functionality is production-ready, but the dashboard interface is completely broken:

- **âœ… Core Audit Pipeline:** 100% functional with YAML-driven configuration
- **âœ… Persona-Aware System:** Dynamic analysis for any role/industry/context
- **âœ… Multi-Provider AI:** Anthropic + OpenAI integration with fallbacks
- **âœ… Data Pipeline:** Structured CSV/Parquet outputs for analytics
- **ðŸš¨ Dashboard Interface:** 0% functional due to critical runtime errors

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Stop all new feature development and focus on:

1. Emergency bug fixing to get a working dashboard
2. Stability testing before any enhancement work
3. Incremental rollout of business intelligence features
4. Update all planning documents to reflect current reality

The technical foundation is solid, but the user interface requires immediate emergency attention before any strategic enhancements can be pursued.
