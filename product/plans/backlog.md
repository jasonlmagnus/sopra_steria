**Status:** Dashboard functional at http://localhost:8502  
**Current Focus:** User validation testing  
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2024

## üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**

### User Validation Testing

- [ ] Executive dashboard displays brand health metrics correctly
- [ ] Persona insights tab functional with filtering
- [ ] Content matrix shows performance data
- [ ] Opportunity analysis generates actionable insights
- [ ] Success library identifies high-performing content
- [ ] Reports export functionality working
- [ ] No runtime errors during navigation

## üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY**

### Dashboard Consolidation (12 ‚Üí 6 Tabs)

**Problem:** Too many scattered pages with overlapping functionality
**Solution:** Merge redundant pages into focused strategic tabs

- [ ] Merge Executive Summary into Main Dashboard
- [ ] Merge Overview into Content Matrix
- [ ] Consolidate Persona Comparison + Persona Experience ‚Üí Persona Insights
- [ ] Merge Criteria Deep Dive into Opportunity & Impact
- [ ] Remove duplicate functionality across tabs

### AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis

**Problem:** 100% "Neutral" sentiment, 98.5% "Low" conversion (broken keyword analysis)
**Solution:** Replace with AI-driven assessment using audit evidence

- [ ] Design AI prompt for sentiment/engagement/conversion analysis
- [ ] Integrate with existing AI interface
- [ ] Update backfill_packager.py to use AI assessment
- [ ] Validate meaningful variation in dashboard metrics

### Strategic Assessment Algorithm Redesign

**Problem:** Distinctiveness & Conversion use identical calculations (both = 5.8/10)
**Solution:** Create distinct algorithms for each strategic question

- [ ] **Distinctiveness:** Use first_impression + brand_percentage + language_tone_feedback
- [ ] **Resonance:** Use sentiment_numeric + engagement_numeric + success_flag
- [ ] **Conversion:** Use conversion_numeric + trust_credibility + performance_percentage
- [ ] Update metrics_calculator.py with new algorithms
- [ ] Update dashboard to show differentiated insights

### Move Methodology to YAML Configuration

**Problem:** Methodology hardcoded in `methodology_parser.py`
**Solution:** Extract to structured YAML for easy editing

- [ ] Create comprehensive `methodology.yaml` with tiers, criteria, weights
- [ ] Update `MethodologyParser` to read from YAML
- [ ] Add YAML structure validation
- [ ] Update documentation for new configuration approach
