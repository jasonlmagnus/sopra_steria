# Implementation Plan: Persona Experience & Brand Audit Tool

This document breaks down the development work for the tool into a prioritized, task-based plan.

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - All Core Phases Implemented**

---

## **PHASE 1: Core Persona Experience Report (✅ COMPLETE)**

_This phase focused on building the end-to-end pipeline for the primary goal: generating the Persona Experience Report._

- [x] **Project Setup**: Virtual environment, dependencies, `.env`.
- [x] **Initial Scaffolding**: `audit_tool/` directory and empty module files.
- [x] **Core Scraper Implementation**: `Scraper` class with `fetch_page`.
- [x] **Core AI & Narrative Generator Implementation**: `AIInterface` with `generate_narrative`, `NarrativeGenerator` class.
- [x] **Core Reporting Implementation**: `Reporter` class with a basic save method.
- [x] **Main Application Wiring**: `main.py` with `argparse`, component orchestration.

---

## **PHASE 2: Brand Hygiene Scorecard (✅ COMPLETE)**

_This phase implemented the tool's second core output: a deterministic, methodology-driven Brand Hygiene Scorecard._

- [x] **Scraper Enhancement for Objective Data**: Implemented objective checks.
- [x] **Methodology Parser & Rules Engine**: `MethodologyParser` and `Criterion`, `Tier`, `Methodology` dataclasses.
- [x] **Scorecard Generator Implementation**: `ScorecardGenerator` with tier classification and AI-assisted scoring.
- [x] **Reporter Enhancement for Dual Output**: `Jinja2` integration and `scorecard_template.md`.
- [x] **Final Integration in Main**: Added `ScorecardGenerator` to the main execution flow.

---

## **PHASE 3: Bug Fixing & Stabilization (✅ COMPLETE)**

_This phase addressed critical bugs and stability issues to ensure the tool is reliable and produces accurate, high-quality output._

- [x] **Robustness**:
  - [x] Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
  - [x] Implemented a retry mechanism for failed API calls in `ai_interface.py`.
  - [x] Implemented robust JSON parsing in `SummaryGenerator` to prevent crashes from malformed AI responses.
- [x] **Core Logic Correction**:
  - [x] **Fixed Persona-Ignoring Bug**: Overhauled the `generate_narrative` prompt in `ai_interface.py` to correctly and forcefully adopt the persona's point of view, removing conflicting instructions.
  - [x] **Fixed Template Crashing Bugs**: Corrected multiple `UndefinedError` crashes in Jinja2 templates by aligning the variables in the templates (`scorecard_template.md`, `summary_template.md`) with the data objects passed from `reporter.py`.
- [x] **Usability**:
  - [x] Added support for batch processing a list of URLs from a file (`--file` argument).
  - [x] Added progress indicators (`tqdm`) for long-running processes.
  - [x] Implemented a file-based caching layer for scraped content to speed up iterative testing.

---

## **PHASE 4: Strategic Summary Generation (✅ COMPLETE)**

_This phase introduced the final component: a generator that synthesizes all individual audit reports into a single, high-level strategic summary._

- [x] **Summary Generator Scaffolding**:
  - [x] In `audit_tool/generators.py`, created the `SummaryGenerator` class.
  - [x] In `audit_tool/reporter.py`, added the `write_summary_report` method.
  - [x] Created the Jinja2 template: `templates/summary_template.md`.
- [x] **Quantitative Data Aggregation**:
  - [x] The `SummaryGenerator` now parses all `_hygiene_scorecard.md` files.
  - [x] It extracts scores, calculates tier averages, and identifies top/bottom pages.
- [x] **Qualitative Thematic Synthesis**:
  - [x] The `SummaryGenerator` parses all `_experience_report.md` files.
  - [x] It uses a dedicated `generate_strategic_summary` method in the `AIInterface` to perform thematic analysis and generate a JSON summary.
- [x] **Final Integration in Main**:
  - [x] After the main URL loop, the `SummaryGenerator` is called to create the summary object, which is then saved by the `Reporter`.

---

## **PHASE 5: UI/UX Development (✅ COMPLETE)**

_This phase focused on building a user-friendly interface for the tool, moving beyond the command line._

- [x] **Task 1: Static UI Layout** - Created `dashboard/streamlit_dashboard.py` with sidebar and main panel components.
- [x] **Task 2: State Management and Input Logic** - Implemented session state tracking and input validation.
- [x] **Task 3: Backend Process Execution** - Integrated subprocess execution with temporary file management.
- [x] **Task 4: Real-time Log Streaming** - Added live audit log display with real-time updates.
- [x] **Task 5: Results Discovery and Parsing** - Implemented automated results scanning and grouping.
- [x] **Task 6: Dynamic Results Display** - Created expandable results with tabbed content display.
- [x] **Task 7: Final Polish & Cleanup** - Added error handling, temp file cleanup, and user feedback.

---

## **PHASE 6: Complete Architecture Transformation (✅ COMPLETE - December 2024)**

_This phase eliminated all hardcoding and created a fully configurable, persona-aware system._

- [x] **YAML-Driven Configuration**:
  - [x] Created comprehensive `methodology.yaml` (542 lines) with all scoring criteria, weights, and rules
  - [x] Rebuilt `MethodologyParser` to be 100% YAML-driven
  - [x] Eliminated ALL hardcoded values from the audit pipeline
- [x] **Persona-Aware System**:
  - [x] Enhanced `PersonaParser` with structured attribute extraction
  - [x] Created configurable prompt templates in `audit_inputs/prompts/`
  - [x] Made AI interface completely persona-driven
- [x] **Robust Architecture**:
  - [x] Fixed path resolution to work from any directory
  - [x] Enhanced data models with comprehensive attributes
  - [x] Integrated `StrategicSummaryGenerator` with YAML methodology
- [x] **Test Infrastructure**:
  - [x] Organized tests in `audit_tool/tests/` directory
  - [x] Created comprehensive test suite covering 5 components
  - [x] Achieved working end-to-end pipeline (7.4/10 test score)

## **PHASE 7: Future Enhancements (PLANNED)**

_This phase outlines potential future work to further improve the tool._

- **[ ] Task 1: Historical Trend Analysis**

  - **Goal:** Allow users to compare audit results over time to track improvements.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Modify the `Reporter` to save outputs in timestamped directories.
    - Add a UI component to select and compare two different audit runs.
    - Visualize score changes and highlight new or resolved issues.

- **[ ] Task 2: Advanced Visualization**

  - **Goal:** Make the quantitative data easier to digest.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Integrate a charting library (e.g., Altair, Vega-Lite) into the Streamlit dashboard.
    - Create bar charts for tier scores and radar charts for individual criteria scores.

- **[ ] Task 3: Multi-Language Support**

  - **Goal:** Support personas and content in multiple languages.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Add language detection to scraped content
    - Create language-specific prompt templates
    - Support personas with different language preferences

- **[ ] Task 4: Cloud Deployment**
  - **Goal:** Make the tool easily accessible to non-technical users.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Write a Dockerfile for the application.
    - Create a deployment script or guide for deploying the Streamlit app to a cloud service.
