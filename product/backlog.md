# Product Backlog

## High Priority Enhancements

### AI-Driven Sentiment, Engagement & Conversion Assessment

**Status:** Backlog  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium

**Problem:**
Current sentiment, engagement, and conversion metrics are generated by simplistic keyword-based analysis in `backfill_packager.py`, resulting in:

- 100% "Neutral" sentiment (no variation)
- 98.5% "Low" conversion (minimal variation)
- Misleading dashboard metrics that suggest sophisticated analysis when it's just broken keyword counting

**Solution:**
Replace keyword-based analysis with AI-driven assessment during the backfill process:

1. **Design AI Prompt** for sentiment/engagement/conversion analysis that:

   - Analyzes the complete audit rationale and evidence
   - Considers persona-specific context and priorities
   - Provides nuanced assessment beyond simple positive/negative/neutral
   - Evaluates engagement potential from persona perspective
   - Assesses conversion likelihood based on business context

2. **Integration Approach:**

   - Add AI assessment step to `backfill_packager.py`
   - Use existing AI interface (`ai_interface.py`)
   - Process audit results through dedicated prompt
   - Generate meaningful sentiment/engagement/conversion values

3. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - Meaningful variation in sentiment scores
   - Persona-relevant engagement assessments
   - Business-context-aware conversion likelihood
   - Dashboard metrics that provide actual insights

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AI prompt designed and tested for sentiment/engagement/conversion assessment
- [ ] Integration implemented in backfill process
- [ ] Dashboard shows meaningful variation in metrics
- [ ] Metrics correlate with audit scores and persona priorities
- [ ] Documentation updated with new assessment methodology

**Dependencies:**

- Existing AI interface and audit pipeline
- Dashboard metrics removal/replacement coordination
