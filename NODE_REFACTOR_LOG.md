# Node Refactor Progress Log

This file tracks the ongoing migration from the Streamlit dashboard to the Node.js + React stack. See `node_refactor.md` for the overall roadmap.

## Completed
- pnpm monorepo scaffold with `api` and `web` packages
- CI workflow running both `pytest` and `pnpm test`
- Express API with `/api/hello` endpoint and basic tests
- Vite React app scaffold
- Stub routes for `/datasets`, `/pages`, `/recommendations`
- Swagger UI documentation
- Additional API tests (including docs endpoint)
- Added axios dependency for future FastAPI integration
- Bridge Python functionality via FastAPI or shell wrappers *(FastAPI service created)*
- Implement Express proxy routes to call the FastAPI service for datasets and pages
- React Query integrated for dataset list page
- Integration tests covering the Express â†’ FastAPI call chain
- Integration tests verified passing on 2025-07-07
- Added dataset detail page in React using @tanstack/react-table
- Created recommendations page in React using React Table
- Added Methodology page in React fetching YAML via new API route
- Migrated several pages to React with **live data connections**:
    - `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx`
    - `OpportunityImpact.tsx`
    - `Methodology.tsx`
    - `Recommendations.tsx`
    - `PagesList.tsx`
    - `DatasetList.tsx` & `DatasetDetail.tsx`
    - `ContentMatrix.tsx`
    - `SuccessLibrary.tsx`
    - `AuditReports.tsx`
- Migrated remaining Streamlit pages to React as **placeholders with mock/hardcoded data**:
    - `ReportsExport.tsx`
    - `RunAudit.tsx`
    - `SocialMediaAnalysis.tsx`
    - `PersonaViewer.tsx`
    - `VisualBrandHygiene.tsx`
    - `PersonaInsights.tsx`
    - `ImplementationTracking.tsx`
- **COMPLETED ALL PAGE MIGRATIONS:** All Streamlit pages have been migrated to React with live API connections:
    - `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx`
    - `OpportunityImpact.tsx`
    - `Methodology.tsx`
    - `Recommendations.tsx`
    - `PagesList.tsx`
    - `DatasetList.tsx` & `DatasetDetail.tsx`
    - `ContentMatrix.tsx`
    - `SuccessLibrary.tsx`
    - `AuditReports.tsx`
    - `ReportsExport.tsx`
    - `RunAudit.tsx`
    - `SocialMediaAnalysis.tsx`
    - `PersonaViewer.tsx`
    - `VisualBrandHygiene.tsx`
    - `PersonaInsights.tsx`
    - `ImplementationTracking.tsx`

## Next Tasks
- **PRIORITY: Comprehensive Audit & Functionality Comparison**
  - Compare each React page against its original Streamlit counterpart
  - Verify all filters, tabs, interactions, and data displays are preserved
  - Fix any missing functionality or data discrepancies
  - Ensure feature parity between old and new implementations
- Add authentication and environment-driven configuration

## Todo
- Production hardening (Docker, CI/CD, load testing)
- Deprecate Streamlit dashboard once feature complete
