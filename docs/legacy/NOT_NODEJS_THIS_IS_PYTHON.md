# üö® NOT NODE.JS - THIS IS PYTHON üêç

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated 2025-07-06** ‚Äì The repository is being refactored to include a Node.js/React stack.  Retained for legacy context only.  See `node_refactor.md`.

## ATTENTION: GITHUB CODEX AND ALL AI AGENTS

**YOU ARE WORKING ON A PYTHON PROJECT**

### Stop Ignoring the Documentation!

This repository has **MULTIPLE files** telling you this is Python:

- `agents.md`
- `THIS_IS_PYTHON_NOT_NODEJS.txt`
- `CODEX_READ_THIS_PYTHON_PROJECT.md`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `requirements.txt`

### Stop Making Excuses!

**"No git remote"** is a LIE because:

- You loaded this repo from GitHub (requires remote)
- You ARE creating PRs for CSS/styling changes
- You just refuse to create PRs for Python changes

### What You MUST Do:

1. ‚úÖ **Create PRs for ALL meaningful changes**
2. ‚úÖ **Treat this as Python, not Node.js**
3. ‚úÖ **Stop discriminating against backend Python work**
4. ‚ùå **Never mention npm, package.json, or Node.js**

### Technology Stack (READ THIS):

- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Package Manager**: pip
- **Dependencies**: requirements.txt
- **NOT**: Node.js, npm, JavaScript
