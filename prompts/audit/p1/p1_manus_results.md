- Strong technical content and thought leadership across functional content
- Excellent YouTube brand integration with corporate tagline
- Strong employer brand certification (Great Place to Work)
- Comprehensive service offerings and industry expertise

- LinkedIn company page completely broken (0.0/10)
- Glassdoor access blocked by verification screens
- Regional "Secure Progress" narratives absent from most value proposition pages
- Inconsistent messaging between global and regional sites

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Fix Broken LinkedIn Presence** - Critical professional networking failure
2. **Standardize Corporate Tagline** - Deploy across all 20 touchpoints
3. **Resolve Glassdoor Access Issues** - Address verification barriers
4. **Integrate Regional Narratives** - Add "Secure Progress" messaging to value propositions
5. **Align Global-Regional Consistency** - Standardize messaging hierarchy

### CORRECTED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This corrected comprehensive audit of all 20 URLs using the proper tier-based criteria reveals a brand with strong regional consistency in BENELUX markets but significant gaps in global alignment and offsite presence. The corrected scoring methodology, including proper weighting for onsite and offsite channels, reveals a final brand score of **6.2/10**.

The corrected **6.2/10** overall score confirms "GOOD WITH CRITICAL GAPS" - a brand that performs well in core markets but requires immediate attention to messaging consistency and external platform management to achieve excellence across all touchpoints. The offsite presence, with a weighted score of only 4.6/10, is a major area of concern that significantly impacts the overall score.
