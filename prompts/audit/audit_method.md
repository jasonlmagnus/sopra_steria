- **Brand Consistency (80%):** "The world is how we shape it" corporate positioning present, European identity clear, human-centric technology vision evident
- **Performance (20%):** Clear strategic direction, trust signals present, optimistic technology approach
- **Don't Evaluate:** Regional narratives, persona-specific pain points, tactical implementation details

- **Performance (50%):** Strategic value clear, risk-innovation balance, proof points, business outcome focus

- Apply correct tier-based weighting (80/20, 50/50, or 30/70)
- Focus on complete brand framework alignment
- Provide evidence-based scoring with specific quotes
- Include brand consistency check regardless of Tier

### 🔒 HARD GATING RULES (Non-Negotiable)

1. Corporate tagline "The world is how we shape it" **missing** ⇒ _Corporate Positioning Alignment ≤ 3_.
2. Required regional or sub-narrative **missing** ⇒ _Regional Narrative Integration ≤ 4_.
3. Page copy < 50 words, obviously broken, or placeholder text ⇒ _Maximum TOTAL page score = 4_.

### 📑 EVIDENCE QUOTE REQUIREMENT

For every criterion scored **7 or higher** the auditor **MUST** paste a **verbatim quote of ≥ 25 words** from the page inside a Markdown block-quote (`>`).  
For every criterion scored **4 or lower** the auditor **MUST** paste a **verbatim quote showing the poor content** that justifies the low score.  
If quotes are missing or < 25 words, deduct **-2 points** from that criterion.

### ✍️ COPY-QUALITY PENALTY FLAGS

### 🟢 GOOD vs 🔴 BAD EXAMPLES

Why it scores 9/10:
• Tagline present and prominent  
• Regional narrative integrated  
• Quantified local proof-points  
• Human-centric, inspirational tone

**BAD Tier-1 Example (scores 3/10 – Tagline Missing)**

Why it scores 3/10:
• No tagline or positioning  
• Pure service list, zero narrative  
• No emotion, no differentiation  
• Triggers _Gating Rule #1_ → Alignment ≤ 3

### TIER 2 & 3 CALIBRATION EXAMPLES

**GOOD Tier-2 Example (Strategic Value Clarity 9/10)**

> "Deploy compliant, fair and ethical AI that meets European standards – our clients have achieved 40% efficiency gains in customer support and 25% logistics cost reduction within 12 months. 4,000 AI specialists across Europe ensure full DORA & GDPR compliance while delivering measurable ROI through our proven three-pillar implementation framework."

Why it scores 9/10:
• Concrete quantified outcomes (40%, 25% improvements)
• Regulatory compliance specificity (DORA, GDPR)
• Scale demonstration (4,000 specialists)
• Clear business value with timelines

**BAD Tier-2 Example (Strategic Value Clarity 4/10)**

> "AI is an essential asset for the future. We help you energize your collective intelligence and optimize processes for better performance through cutting-edge solutions."

Why it scores 4/10:
• Empty jargon ("essential asset," "cutting-edge") → Copy-quality flag -1
• No quantified outcomes or metrics
• Generic corporate speak without specificity
• No regulatory or compliance context

**GOOD Tier-3 Example (Executive Relevance 9/10)**

Early movers in pharmaceuticals and logistics are already realizing 30% cost-to-serve reductions, while 73% of executives cite quantum readiness as critical for competitive advantage in the next decade."

Why it scores 9/10:
• Concrete market data ($1.25B, $1T projections)
• Executive-relevant timeline (next decade)
• Quantified business impact (30% cost reduction)
• Strategic competitive context (73% of executives)

**BAD Tier-3 Example (Executive Relevance 4/10)**

> "Quantum computers are difficult to build because they must be perfectly isolated to behave quantum mechanically, yet we need to input data and extract results at the end."

Why it scores 4/10:
• Technical trivia without business context
• No market data or strategic implications
• No executive decision-making relevance
• Missing ROI or competitive advantage discussion
