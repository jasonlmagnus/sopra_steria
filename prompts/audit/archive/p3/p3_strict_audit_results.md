| Netherlands Homepage | 6.0/10      | Missing sub-narratives, identical content to Belgium |

### CRITICAL COMPLIANCE FINDINGS:

**GATING RULES APPLIED:**

**EVIDENCE QUOTES COLLECTED:**

- ✅ All scores ≥7 have supporting ≥25-word quotes
- ✅ All scores ≤4 have supporting quotes showing poor content

**COPY QUALITY PENALTIES:**

- Empty jargon penalties applied consistently (-1 point each)
- "driving innovation in dynamic business environment" flagged across sites

**AVERAGE SCORE: 5.6/10** (vs. previous inflated scores of 7-8/10)

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

**HIGH URGENCY:**

2. Implement corporate tagline across all properties
3. Establish LinkedIn company presence
4. Create YouTube channel

**MEDIUM URGENCY:**

1. Develop and integrate regional sub-narratives

3. Address Glassdoor accessibility issues

**VALIDATION OF STRICT METHODOLOGY:**

- Gating rules working as intended
- Evidence requirements eliminating score inflation
- Copy quality penalties consistently applied
