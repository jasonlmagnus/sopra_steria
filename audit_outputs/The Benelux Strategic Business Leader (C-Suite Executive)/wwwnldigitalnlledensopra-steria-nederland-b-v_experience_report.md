| Ineffective Copy | "Wij zijn Ordina. Samen vormen wij de grootste, lokale IT-dienstverlener in de Benelux. En dat zijn we niet zomaar. We zijn er altijd voor onze klanten en helpen hen om problemen op te lossen."                                                        | This is vague branding with no clear articulation of unique value or strategic outcomes. As a C-suite executive, I need to understand why Ordina (or Sopra Steria – the text is inconsistent) is a partner that can help me overcome my key challenges such as legacy systems, cybersecurity, and talent shortages. Generic claims like "always there for customers" do not inspire confidence or differentiate in a crowded IT services market.                                                    |
| Ineffective Copy | "We gebruiken technologie als antwoord op organisatie-uitdagingen en bedenken slimme en innovatieve oplossingen. Dat doen we van kop tot staart: we bedenken, bouwen én beheren toepassingen waar onze klanten mee geholpen zijn."                   | While this implies end-to-end capabilities, it remains a buzzword-heavy statement without concrete evidence or specifics. I want to see how these “innovative solutions” translate into measurable business impact—revenue growth, operational resilience, or risk reduction. Without clear linkage to strategic priorities, this copy fails to engage me on the executive level.                                                                                              |

[...] Zo creëert het Havenbedrijf meer capaciteit en draait het nieuwe boekingssysteem bij aan een slimme haven." | This passage describing the KING 3.0 system provides a tangible example of technology driving operational efficiency and capacity optimization. It’s useful because it shows concrete outcomes (reduced phone calls, guaranteed bookings, shorter ship stay times) that align with my priorities around operational excellence and resilience. This kind of real-world impact resonates with my strategic concerns.                                                     |

[...] Nooit eerder heb ik meegemaakt dat een team zo snel up en running was."                     | This demonstrates responsiveness and agility in addressing a critical cybersecurity threat—credit card fraud—with a dedicated expert team. The testimonial adds credibility. This example aligns with my concerns around cybersecurity threats and talent shortages, showing that the company can mobilize specialized resources quickly to safeguard business interests.                                                                                 |

As a C-suite executive, I expect a clear, direct next step or offer to engage—whether a strategic consultation, case study download, or executive briefing. “Look at our website” does not convey a sense of urgency or relevance at my level.                                                                                                                                                          |

As a Benelux C-suite executive responsible for steering large enterprises through complex digital transformations and external volatility, my first impression of this page is one of confusion and missed opportunity. The page opens with an overwhelming and irrelevant cookie policy section, which immediately dilutes focus and distracts from strategic messaging. When I finally reach the core content, the value proposition is muddled by inconsistent branding (mentioning Ordina under a Sopra Steria heading) and generic claims that fail to articulate how this provider uniquely addresses my top pain points such as legacy systems, cybersecurity threats, and talent shortages. The absence of a strong, clear executive-level value statement is a critical gap.

The language occasionally resonates when concrete case examples are provided, such as the KING 3.0 booking system for the Rotterdam port and the “Credit Guards” team supporting Rabobank’s fraud detection. These stories show measurable operational improvements, agility, and innovation—elements that align with my priorities for growth, resilience, and efficiency. However, these highlights are buried within verbose and technical descriptions that lack strategic framing or outcome quantification. The tone is functional but rarely compelling from an executive perspective. Calls to action are weak and fail to invite meaningful engagement at my level.

Crucially, the page lacks proof points such as KPIs, business outcomes, or client references that demonstrate how the company’s technology solutions tangibly mitigate my risks or accelerate growth. There is no clear articulation of how they help overcome legacy system inertia or talent gaps, nor any insight into their approach to cybersecurity beyond a single fraud detection example. Trust is partially built through client testimonials and specific project outcomes, but this is undermined by inconsistent branding and the cluttered, unfocused presentation.

For this page to be impactful for a C-suite audience, I would recommend a complete overhaul of the messaging hierarchy. Start with a succinct, differentiated value proposition focused on strategic business outcomes relevant to Benelux enterprises. Remove or relocate technical cookie details to avoid distraction. Highlight key challenges addressed—legacy modernization, cybersecurity, supply chain resilience—and back these with data-driven case studies and executive testimonials. Finally, offer a clear, direct call to engage with senior consultants or executive briefings to facilitate meaningful next steps. Without these improvements, the page risks being overlooked by decision-makers who need clarity, confidence, and a compelling reason to initiate dialogue.
