## Executive Summary - From the C-Suite Perspective

As a Benelux C-suite executive evaluating Sopra Steria's digital presence, I find a mixed picture that requires immediate attention. With an overall brand score of 5.9/10, this digital estate presents both significant opportunities and critical gaps that impact my assessment as a potential strategic partner.

The audit reveals 2 pages scoring 3/10 or below, indicating fundamental brand positioning issues. Key concerns include inconsistent corporate tagline presence, missing regional narratives, and generic value propositions that fail to address my specific strategic priorities as a C-suite decision-maker.

However, I also see substantial foundation elements in place. Sopra Steria's scale, European presence, and technical capabilities are evident - the challenge is translating these strengths into clear business value propositions that resonate with strategic decision-makers in my position.
