**🎯 Top Recommendation (High Priority Issue: Lack of Brand Messaging and Persona Relevance**  
   - Implement a branded landing page or channel homepage that loads before or instead of the YouTube cookie consent screen, clearly communicating Sopra Steria’s core messages, value propositions, and relevance to the persona.  
   - Include content that highlights operational efficiency, compliance, security, and innovation to resonate with the persona’s priorities.

2. **Medium Priority Issue: Absence of Trust and Credibility Signals**  
   - Add visible trust indicators such as certifications, client logos, case study links, or testimonials on the channel or associated landing pages to build credibility with technical stakeholders.

3. **Low Priority Issue: Ineffective Calls to Action**  
   - Replace or supplement generic cookie consent CTAs with clear next steps tailored to the persona, such as links to whitepapers, webinars, or contact forms for solution consultations.
