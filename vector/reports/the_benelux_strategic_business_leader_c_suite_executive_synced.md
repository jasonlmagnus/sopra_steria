## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Tier 2 service pages lead** (_6.0/10_) with concrete language on risk mitigation, yet lack quantified breach-reduction metrics.
- **Tier 3 press / blog items** feel marketing-heavy; deeper technical evidence would raise credibility.
- Trust cues (ISO, NIS2 readiness) are scattered — consolidate them high on every page.
- CTAs default to "Contact us"; offer **Rapid Compliance Gap Scan** to capture my intent.
- Regional social feeds under-represent local threat intel; I crave Benelux-specific insights.

## Social Media Presence (My Perspective)

**Overall Impression:** Global activity is robust, yet local executive discourse barely registers on my radar.

| Platform         | Followers | Engagement | Strength                      | Weakness                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| LinkedIn Global  | 866 000   | High       | Consistent thought leadership | Little Benelux relevance  |
| LinkedIn Benelux | 1 200     | Low↑       | Authentic employee spotlights | Reach too small for peers |
| Twitter Global   | 10 000    | Moderate   | Timely leadership updates     | Lacks strategic depth     |

**Key Observations:**

- My feed rarely surfaces Benelux success stories or compliance wins.
- Engagement spikes on global posts hint at appetite — localisation would amplify impact.

**Priority Recommendation:** Publish monthly Benelux C-suite case briefs on LinkedIn to lift regional engagement **+25 %**.

## Journey Commentary

From my journey across Sopra Steria's digital estate, I enjoy insightful Tier 2 content but stumble when generic Tier 3 press releases and missing contact forms break momentum.

**Top Synergy Opportunity:** Elevate EU-regulatory expertise consistently across all tiers — it hooks my attention every time.
**Top Friction Point:** Generic or absent contact forms derail conversion just as I'm ready to engage with experts.
