## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Tier 2 service pages lead** (_5.6/10_) with concrete language on risk mitigation, yet lack quantified breach-reduction metrics.
- **Tier 3 press / blog items** feel marketing-heavy; deeper technical evidence would raise credibility.
- Trust cues (ISO, NIS2 readiness) are scattered — consolidate them high on every page.
- CTAs default to "Contact us"; offer **Rapid Compliance Gap Scan** to capture my intent.
- Regional social feeds under-represent local threat intel; I crave Benelux-specific insights.

## Social Media Presence (My Perspective)

**Overall Impression:** Global channels show authority, yet regional threat discussions are rare.

| Platform         | Followers | Engagement | Strength                | Weakness                    |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| LinkedIn Global  | 866 000   | High       | Frequent security posts | Minimal Benelux relevance   |
| LinkedIn Benelux | 1 200     | Low↑       | Employee spotlights     | Scarce threat-intel sharing |
| Twitter Global   | 10 000    | Moderate   | Timely vuln alerts      | Few long-form insights      |

**Key Observations:**

- I seldom see local breach case studies or compliance wins.
- High engagement on global alerts signals appetite — localisation would resonate.

**Priority Recommendation:** Publish quarterly Benelux SOC snapshots with actionable guidance.

## Journey Commentary

I appreciate clear risk language on Tier 2 pages, yet momentum dies when press releases read like ads and contact forms request too much detail.

**Top Synergy Opportunity:** Link Tier 3 blog insights directly to Tier 2 service CTAs for seamless escalation.  
**Top Friction Point:** Over-generic forms slow urgent inquiries — provide direct CISO hotline or chat.
