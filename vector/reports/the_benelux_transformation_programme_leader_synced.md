## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Tier 2 service pages lead** (_6.0/10_) with concrete language on risk mitigation, yet lack quantified breach-reduction metrics.
- **Tier 3 press / blog items** feel marketing-heavy; deeper technical evidence would raise credibility.
- Trust cues (ISO, NIS2 readiness) are scattered — consolidate them high on every page.
- CTAs default to "Contact us"; offer **Rapid Compliance Gap Scan** to capture my intent.
- Regional social feeds under-represent local threat intel; I crave Benelux-specific insights.

## Social Media Presence (My Perspective)

**Overall Impression:** Culture stories abound, yet hard transformation wins are rare.

| Platform         | Followers | Engagement | Strength                   | Weakness                      |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| LinkedIn Global  | 866 000   | High       | Frequent recognition posts | ROI numbers scarce            |
| LinkedIn Benelux | 1 200     | Low↑       | Employee pride content     | Transformation metrics absent |
| YouTube Global   | 4 700     | Moderate   | Case-study videos          | Few programme retrospects     |

**Key Observations:**

- I seldom find post-implementation reviews or benefit-realisation clips.
- Engagement spikes on recognition posts show appetite — layer in KPI stories.

**Priority Recommendation:** Release 2-minute post-go-live debrief videos quarterly.

## Journey Commentary

Tier 2 pages ignite my interest, but the path to proof is fragmented; I hit generic forms before seeing ROI evidence.

**Top Synergy Opportunity:** Link Tier 3 case stories to Tier 2 frameworks for seamless credence.  
**Top Friction Point:** Absence of interactive value calculators delays internal buy-in.
