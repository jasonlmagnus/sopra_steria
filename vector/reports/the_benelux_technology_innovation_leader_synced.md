## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Tier 2 service pages lead** (_0.0/10_) with concrete language on risk mitigation, yet lack quantified breach-reduction metrics.
- **Tier 3 press / blog items** feel marketing-heavy; deeper technical evidence would raise credibility.
- Trust cues (ISO, NIS2 readiness) are scattered ‚Äî consolidate them high on every page.
- CTAs default to "Contact us"; offer **Rapid Compliance Gap Scan** to capture my intent.
- Regional social feeds under-represent local threat intel; I crave Benelux-specific insights.

## Tier Performance Analysis
## Strategic Ideas

- Publish an **Innovation Velocity Index** benchmarking time-to-value against EU competitors.
- Sponsor a quarterly **Tech-Talk Live** series spotlighting in-house engineers and client architects.

## Social Media Presence (My Perspective)

**Overall Impression:** Global channels pulse with announcements, but technical depth and regional flavour are limited.

| Platform         | Followers | Engagement | Strength                  | Weakness                      |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| LinkedIn Global  | 866 000   | High       | Frequent thought pieces   | Benelux tech stories rare     |
| LinkedIn Benelux | 1 200     | Low‚Üë       | Authentic employee posts  | Minimal engineering content   |
| YouTube Global   | 4 700     | Moderate   | Quality case-study videos | Few architecture walkthroughs |

**Key Observations:**

- I rarely see code walk-throughs or platform demos in my feed.
- Engagement surges on culture posts, indicating appetite for behind-the-scenes tech stories.

**Priority Recommendation:** Release quarterly "Engineering Deep-Dive" videos aligned to regional case studies.

## Journey Commentary

Across Sopra Steria's channels I find credible AI and Cloud narratives, but the leap from concept to hands-on demo is missing.

**Top Synergy Opportunity:** Connect Tier 2 service pages directly to Tier 3 blog demos for seamless discovery.  
**Top Friction Point:** Generic contact forms block rapid PoC requests ‚Äî a one-click sandbox trial would accelerate decisions.
