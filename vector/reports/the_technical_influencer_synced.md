## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Tier 2 service pages lead** (_5.7/10_) with concrete language on risk mitigation, yet lack quantified breach-reduction metrics.
- **Tier 3 press / blog items** feel marketing-heavy; deeper technical evidence would raise credibility.
- Trust cues (ISO, NIS2 readiness) are scattered — consolidate them high on every page.
- CTAs default to "Contact us"; offer **Rapid Compliance Gap Scan** to capture my intent.
- Regional social feeds under-represent local threat intel; I crave Benelux-specific insights.

## Social Media Presence (My Perspective)

**Overall Impression:** Culture content dominates; deeper technical storytelling would grow developer mindshare.

| Platform         | Followers | Engagement | Strength                   | Weakness                    |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| LinkedIn Global  | 866 000   | High       | Active employer branding   | Sparse code-centric posts   |
| LinkedIn Benelux | 1 200     | Low↑       | Authentic employee stories | Minimal engineering content |
| YouTube Global   | 4 700     | Moderate   | Case-study videos          | Few live-coding sessions    |

**Key Observations:**

- I look for demo days or architecture walkthroughs — rarely find them.
- High engagement on hackathon recaps suggests hunger for building-oriented content.

**Priority Recommendation:** Launch monthly live-coding streams showcasing internal frameworks and client POCs.

## Journey Commentary

Technical specs surface slowly; I often bounce before locating SDKs. Once I find them, credibility improves, but conversion path to sandbox signup is cumbersome.

**Top Synergy Opportunity:** Tie Tier 3 live-coding blogs directly to Tier 2 platform demos for frictionless validation.  
**Top Friction Point:** Excess form fields and NDAs delay sandbox access — adopt instant OAuth login for trials.
